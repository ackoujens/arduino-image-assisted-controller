## Research

- Ability to read video feed and activate pins(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI61dQbY4lU)

- Shield enabling HDMI input/output (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUeIY_gLn3c)

## RPI alternative

Reading more about arduino, it seems more and more that it isn't the suitable tool for the job. Steering research more towards RPI to see what it's able to do.

Using arduino HDMI as output.
Using Eth or USB to HDMI as inputs.

Test code in link below if I'm able to get this to run on my RPI's https://github.com/c4software/pi-as-keyboard

Seems that only the weaker versions of the PI are able to simulate a keyboard. The PI thus must team up with an general or leonardo arduino board.
